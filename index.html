        <h2>Welcome to Our Home!üåç‚ú®</h2>
        <p>Are you a university student in Germany looking for an adventure abroad? We're inviting you to come stay with us in northern Argentina for a few months! üá¶üá∑üá©üá™</p>
    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Zoe, I'm a Software Developer and I'm on an exciting journey to learn German. I live in a charming small town in northern Argentina with my boyfriend, Agus, and our five wonderful cats who are the real rulers of our home. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our house is spacious and private, with four bedrooms and three bathrooms, located right in the heart of the city. Everything you need is close by ‚Äî kiosks, restaurants, and even local markets that give you a taste of Argentine culture. 
            Our town is welcoming, and the people here are known for their warmth and friendliness.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about languages and cultures, and I believe that this exchange will not only help me learn German but also create lifelong connections and memories. 
            In exchange, I'd love to teach you Spanish and introduce you to our way of life here in Argentina.
        </p>
        <p>
            Agus is equally excited about the idea of hosting someone from Germany. He's also a software developer, and we both enjoy sharing our home and culture with others. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We've created a home filled with warmth, love, and laughter, and we're excited to open our doors to someone who wants to share in this experience.
        </p>
